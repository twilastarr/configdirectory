- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Step 1 Setup Azure Rescource
- Step 2 Install Active Directory
- Step 3
- Step 4

<p>
Setup Resources in Azure
Create the Domain Controller VM (Windows Server 2022) named “DC-1”
Take note of the Resource Group and Virtual Network (Vnet) that get created at this time
Set Domain Controller’s NIC Private IP address to be static
Create the Client VM (Windows 10) named “Client-1”. Use the same Resource Group and Vnet that was created in Step 1.a
Ensure that both VMs are in the same Vnet (you can check the topology with Network Watcher

</p>
<p>
Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD
  Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
From the Azure Portal, set Client-1’s DNS settings to the DC’s Private IP address
From the Azure Portal, restart Client-1
Login to Client-1 (Remote Desktop) as the original local admin (labuser) and join it to the domain (computer will restart)
Login to the Domain Controller (Remote Desktop) and verify Client-1 shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) inside the “Computers” container on the root of the domain

</p>
<p>
Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users
Login to DC-1 as jane_admin
Open PowerShell_ise as an administrator
Create a new File and paste the contents of the script into it (https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1)
Run the script and observe the accounts being created
When finished, open ADUC and observe the accounts in the appropriate OU
attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the accounts (take note of the password in the script)
